# Cash-Flow-Calculator

## This is a calculator to find your net monthly cash flow. Input your income and expenses to see what's left over.

This code utilizes several JavaScript algorithms to achieve its functionality. The addInputRow function dynamically creates new input rows based on the button clicked, using conditional statements and DOM manipulation. The deleteInputRow function removes a row from the DOM when the corresponding delete button is clicked. 
The calculateSum function calculates the sum of values entered in the input fields by iterating through the elements and aggregating the values. Finally, the add_number function attaches an event listener to the "Sum" button, which triggers the calculation of the expense sums and updates the corresponding input fields.
Additionally, it evaluates the result to display a message or image based on the outcome. These algorithms collectively enable dynamic row manipulation, sum calculations, and result display based on user interaction.
